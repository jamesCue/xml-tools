	<para role="04BodyText">"Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
		Fleece, and I'll away to my supper."</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
		shrill voice, and cried—</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">"Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
		your dam bellies 'till dey bust—and den die."</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">"Now, cook," said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; "stand just

	<title cword:hint="A-Head" cword:level="3" role="05HeadA">Section 2</title>

	<para role="04BodyTextFL">The room was well lighted by a number of large windows and was
		beautifully decorated with mural paintings and mosaics, but upon all there seemed to rest
		that indefinable touch of the finger of antiquity which convinced me that the architects and
		builders of these wondrous creations had nothing in common with the crude half-brutes which
		now occupied them.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">Sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center of
		the room, and, turning, made a peculiar hissing sound, as though signaling to someone in an
		adjoining room. In response to her call I obtained my first sight of a new Martian wonder.
		It waddled in on its ten short legs, and squatted down before the girl like an obedient
		puppy. The thing was about the size of a Shetland pony, but its head bore a slight
		resemblance to that of a frog, except that the jaws were equipped with three rows of long,
		sharp tusks.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">Sola stared into the brute's wicked-looking eyes, muttered a word or two
		of command, pointed to me, and left the chamber. I could not but wonder what this
		ferocious-looking monstrosity might do when left alone in such close proximity to such a
		relatively tender morsel of meat; but my fears were groundless, as the beast, after
		surveying me intently for a moment, crossed the room to the only exit which led to the
		street, and lay down full length across the threshold.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">This was my first experience with a Martian watch dog, but it was
		destined not to be my last, for this fellow guarded me carefully during the time I remained
		a captive among these green men; twice saving my life, and never voluntarily being away from
		me a moment.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">While Sola was away I took occasion to examine more minutely the room in
		which I found myself captive. The mural painting depicted scenes of rare and wonderful
		beauty; mountains, rivers, lake, ocean, meadow, trees and flowers, winding roadways,
		sun-kissed gardens—scenes which might have portrayed earthly views but for the different
		colorings of the vegetation. The work had evidently been wrought by a master hand, so subtle
		the atmosphere, so perfect the technique; yet nowhere was there a representation of a living
		animal, either human or brute, by which I could guess at the likeness of these other and
		perhaps extinct denizens of Mars.</para>

	<title cword:hint="chapter-title" cword:level="2" role="03ChapterNumberandTitle">2. A second sample chapter</title>

	<para role="04BodyTextFL">The ancient caught his staff in a tighter grip and urged along the
		trail, his old eyes shining greedily.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">"I hope Har-Lip 's found a crab... or two," he mumbled. "They're good
		eating, crabs, mighty good eating when you've no more teeth and you've got grandsons that
		love their old grandsire and make a point of catching crabs for him. When I was a
		boy—"</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">But Edwin, suddenly stopped by what he saw, was drawing the bowstring on
		a fitted arrow. He had paused on the brink of a crevasse in the embankment. An ancient
		culvert had here washed out, and the stream, no longer confined, had cut a passage through
		the fill. On the opposite side, the end of a rail projected and overhung. It showed rustily
		through the creeping vines which overran it. Beyond, crouching by a bush, a rabbit looked
		across at him in trembling hesitancy. Fully fifty feet was the distance, but the arrow
		flashed true; and the transfixed rabbit, crying out in sudden fright and hurt, struggled
		painfully away into the brush. The boy himself was a flash of brown skin and flying fur as
		he bounded down the steep wall of the gap and up the other side. His lean muscles were
		springs of steel that released into graceful and efficient action. A hundred feet beyond, in
		a tangle of bushes, he overtook the wounded creature, knocked its head on a convenient
		tree-trunk, and turned it over to Granser to carry.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">"Rabbit is good, very good," the ancient quavered, "but when it comes to
		a toothsome delicacy I prefer crab. When I was a boy—"</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">"Why do you say so much that ain't got no sense?" Edwin impatiently
		interrupted the other's threatened garrulousness.</para>

	<para role="04BodyText">The boy did not exactly utter these words, but something that remotely
		resembled them and that was more guttural and explosive and economical of qualifying
		phrases. His speech showed distant kinship with that of the old man, and the latter's speech
		was approximately an English that had gone through a bath of corrupt usage.</para>
